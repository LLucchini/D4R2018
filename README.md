From mobile phone data to population density

Here we write a simple code to train and test the best model (as proposed by Deville et al. in https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1408439111).
The input data are mobile phone activity densities and the population data with which the model is tested.
The output are the parameters of the model that can be used as general estimators for population densities over the same geographical area the model was trained.
